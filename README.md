# Bukkit-Auto-Installer
#This is made to work on Ubuntu. In the future I plan on making it more widely available to other distros 
#This is a simple thing that will automatically download and install the minecraft bukkit server
#In the shell script replace the download-minecraft-server with the address from bukkit 
#Replace the jar-name with the jar name
#Find the bukkit jar file in on https://www.getbukkit.org/craftbukkit.html
